Möbius strips, as we all learned in science lessons, turn both sides of a strip of paper (or in this case, a flat track) into one continuous looped surface. The students at Ithaca College added three twists to their track, creating a 3π Möbius strip which they then covered with 1,000 magnets so that a liquid nitrogen-cooled superconductor was able to levitate both above and beneath it as it raced in circles.   Superconducting Quantum Levitation on a 3π Möbius Strip    If this is what the Hyperloop would look like one day, potential investors would be lined up around the corner. [ YouTube  via  Geekologie ]   More Watch this Posts:
